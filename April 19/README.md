# TOPIC DISCUSSIONS

## 1. FAKE DEVIATION?
We see that the purpose of Cutie’s rebellious attitude was in relation with the First and Second Law. Is there such a thing as deviation if, in the story, the whole purpose of Cutie creating the religion was in the purpose of protecting Powell and Donovan?

## 2. MACHINE AWARENESS?
A quote from Cutie describes how he and the other machines "exist, because [they] think.” However, will robots be able to reach this level of awareness that they actions are, indeed, at the expense of humans? Or will they subject themself to believing that they are capable of doing things for “robots”?

## 3. WHO IS GOD?
Cutie and the other machines believe that the power house is “The Master” and the god of their religions. However, due to their lack of exposure to humans, would the god of machine religion change depending if they are on earth? If the machines’ gods were the engineers, would they have a greater respect for humans than they did in this story?
