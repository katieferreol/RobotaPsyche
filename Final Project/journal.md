Today was the first day I researched a topic for my final paper. Form the beginning, I knew that I wanted to focus on Artificial Intelligence in the entertainment industry. Being and avid K-Pop fan, I am constantly updated with articles regarding the newest trends in the Korean music industry. What intrigued me greatly was the potential debut of an all AI-girl group named Eternity. Made up of all computer generated members, voices, and music, they are the beginning of the all digital future we will see in entertainment.

However, after seeing the comments of their first music video, it is filled with negative comments, saying how their voices and inhuman movements made them uncomfortable. Personally, I also felt the same thing. But what phenomena make us feel this way?
