## APRIL 14: AI IN ENTERTAINMENT

Today was the first day I researched a topic for my final paper. Form the beginning, I knew that I wanted to focus on Artificial Intelligence in the entertainment industry. Being and avid K-Pop fan, I am constantly updated with articles regarding the newest trends in the Korean music industry. What intrigued me greatly was the potential debut of an all AI-girl group named Eternity. Made up of all computer generated members, voices, and music, they are the beginning of the all digital future we will see in entertainment.

However, after seeing the comments of their first music video, it is filled with negative comments, saying how their voices and inhuman movements made them uncomfortable. Personally, I also felt the same thing. But what phenomena make us feel this way?

## APRIL 17: HUMANS' ROLE IN AI SAFETY

After seeing the negative reactions from others regarding the AI "human-looking" girl group Eternity, I wanted to find reasons as to why this is so. Delving deeper into research, I found the reason behind this is due to the psychological phenomenon called the "uncanny valley" effect, wherein a human feels a discomfort when seeing somethig that looks almost--but not entirely––human.

In addition, I also wanted to bring into my essay the dangers of such artificial intelligence if they end up in the wrong hands. An example of this is the rise of deepfakes: putting one's face on a body that is not theirs. Used for pornographic or political purposes, this caused nothing but negative effects for those made victims.

I want to show how artificial intelligence can be both beneficial and detrimental to humans and how it is our role on how it will be introduced.

## APRIL 18: BEAUTY STANDARDS

Another benefit that I had thought of for AI taking over the entertainment industry is our ability to have more flexible beauty standards. Women constantly compare themselves to Instagram models due to their lavish lifestyle and airbrushed beauty. However, the rise of AI influencers and streamers may put an end to the unrealistic beauty standards faced by humans. An example of these is Twitch V-tuber Code Miko, and AI Instagram star Lil' Miquela.
