# ROBOTA PSYCHE FINAL PAPER

## TITLE
Artificial Intelligence In Mass Media: Virtual Influencers And Their Role In Human Entertainment

## ABSTRACT
This past decade has proved to be a historical time in the development of technology for both practical and entertainment purposes. However, with the rise of social media and the immortality of the world wide web, the price of the entertainment industry may be doing more harm than good in terms of mental wellbeing. Through observing the curation of virtual influencers and robotic supermodels, we begin to see the prominence of machines in such a field, and––through the process––determine the psychological bonds we create with those we see on our screens, whether human or robotic.

## PARTS
This paper is divided into four sections. The first section will delve into the current models of Artificial Intelligence and robotics in the entertainment industry. The second and third sections will cite its benefits and drawbacks, specifically the ability to bring safety to those in the limelight and the dangers of exploitation. The fourth section will determine if humans are able to accept such drastic changes in the entertainment industry, and the psychological reasons and biases preventing us from doing so.
