# LITTLE LOST ROBOT QUESTIONS


## 1. IS INACTION AN ACTION?
The "weakened" first Law of Robotics (omitting harm of humans caused by the inaction of robots) reminds me greatly of the famous Trolley Problem, something we debated on in my Behavioral Economics class. Does inaction, in itself, making a choice to let others be harmed? You are aware of the chaos that is about to ensue, so does doing nothing count as an act of selfishness?

## 2. SPECIFICITY OF COMMANDS
Gerald admits that Nestor 10 had been bothering him and told him to "get lost", to which he ultimately ended up hiding and being "lost" by Gerald. How careful would humans have to be with our words in order not to be misinterpreted by robots? Should they come equipped with machine learning that picks up on human lingo and adapts accordingly? How would this be done in other languages?

## 3. BENEFITS OVER DANGERS?
Though the "weakened" First Law would allow more work to be done especially in more physical-labor heavy environments, does this benefit outweigh the dangers that comes with it? Through robots not being able to protect humans when they are in danger, there is a loophole that they can cross if they feel like harming the human (the dropping of the concrete example in the story).

## 4. ROBOTS IN OUR IMAGE
Asimov coins the term "Frankenstein Complex", where humans have a fear of robots or whatever being that humans themselves created. Seeing as the laws were made by humans themselves, are we the ones responsible for coding deviancy and revenge in robots? Though striving to code perfection, are we subconsciously creating the machines in our image, as we ourselves don't know the meaning of perfection as we have not attained it?

## 5. VOLUNTARY DANGER
Would robots ever be able to work in areas where putting one's life in danger is necessary/voluntary? An example I can think of is euthanasia, wherein a patient asks to be killed in order to save their family and loved ones from the burden of high hospital bills. However, because this goes against the first law, would machines be able to carry this out? Like Nestor 10, would a whole new set of rules have to be coded to ensure best performance?
