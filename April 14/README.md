# FINAL PROJECT

For my final project, I am still not sure about what route I will choose: the paper or the code. With this said, I will make a proposal for both.

## CODING PROJECT

My coding project idea, if I choose to move forward with it, is inspired by the cats at D2 and students' constant complaints of them fighting each other on the highline. I would like to code cats of different colors and have them walk freely around the canvas. However, the orange cat will be aggressive and pick a fight with any cat it sees. The other cats' fear will increase differently if they are the victim of the attack or just an observer: increase 50% if they are the victim, 20% if they are the observer.

Once the cat's fear gets to a high enough threshold, they will start avoiding anything that has to do with the color orange. Whether it is a student wearing an orange shirt, or an orange leaf that has fallen on the ground, their fear gets in the way of them realizing that it is not a cat. I also want to make it so that students slowly begin to realize that wearing orange makes the other cats afraid, so they begin to stop wearing orange shirts.

## WRITING

The discussions we have been having in class has gotten me very curious about the role in robots/artificial intelligence on the future of humans. I currently believe that technology is humans' best friend and worst enemy. I would like to write a paper about how robots and machines are currently portrayed in popular media (movies, TV shows, etc.) and where such thinking came about. 

I also want to delve into the possible benefits and dangers of having AI take over the entertainment industry, delving into the concept of the "uncanny valley effect", or the discomfort we feel when something unhuman is on the brink of looking human. I have recently read about this newly debuted K-Pop group called Eternity that consists of all AI members and songs sung by machines. Though very wary of it in the beginning due to its strange nature, I realized the possible benefit of safety this could bring to idols.

Nowadays, there has been a rise of "deepfake", wherein a celebrity's face is put on the body of another human. This has been used mostly for sexual and pornographic purposes, a disgusting cost of fame. This may cause scars of trauma amongst those whose face was used without their consent. However, if AI begins to slowly replace the entertainment industry, this could remove this fear.
