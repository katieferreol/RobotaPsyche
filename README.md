## GREETING
To whom it may concern,

Good day! These are my projects for the 3000-level class, Robota Psyche. I hope you enjoy looking through my works!

## AIM OF THE COURSE
In Robota Psyche, we aim to develop a critical understanding of the historical and contemporary meaning of cybernetics. This is done through creating software robots to simulate various synthetic psychologies,  and explore how these robots interact with each other.
